===========
Materialist is a minimalist todo list for managing your tasks. It's free, has no ads and uses Material Design.

How is Materialist different from any other todo list? Many todo lists are either overly complicated or leave the user feeling without control. This app has been created to provide a simple, minimalist and intuitive experience that's in the way as little as possible.
